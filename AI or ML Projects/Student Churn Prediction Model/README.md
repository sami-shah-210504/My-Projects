# Student Churn Prediction Model

This project predicts student churn (likelihood of dropping out) based on invoices, marks, and attendance data.  
It uses a trained machine learning model stored in `churn_model.pkl`.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone or download the repository
`git clone https://github.com/sami-shah-210504/My-Projects.git
 cd "My-Projects/AI or ML Projects/Student Churn Prediction Model`

### 2. Install dependencies
`pip install -r dependencies.txt`
### 3. Prepare input files
Place your CSV data files into the data/ folder.
Ensure the filenames match those in main.py or update the script accordingly.

## ▶️ Running the Project
### 1. To run predictions
`python main.py`
### 2. Prepare input files

The output will be saved in output/predictions.csv.

The visuals for the model will also be saved in output/feature_importance.png and output/tree_visualization.png.

## Important Note
The input data *must* be in the following format;
### 1. Attendance Data:
Should be given in *four* CSV files.
*Must* have the columns 'ATT_STATUS', 'ATT_DATE', and 'SYSTEM_ID'.
Each file should be named 'att1.csv', 'att2.csv', etc.
### 2. Invoice Data:
*Must* have the columns 'PAID_DATE', 'DUE_DATE', 'SYSTEM_ID'.
File should be named 'invoice.csv'.
### 3. Grades Data:
*Must* have the columns 'TERM_NAME', 'SUBJECT_NAME', 'OBTAINED_MARKS', 'TOTAL_MARKS', 'SYSTEM_ID'.
File should be named 'marks.csv'.
