This was a project given to me at the end of semester 4 for my Computer Organization and Assembly Language course. 
The objective of this project is to design and implement the classic Snake Game
using Assembly Language for the 8088 platform. The game will run in text mode
or graphics mode (depending on system and emulator capabilities) and will allow the
player to control a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food and
growing while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.
This project demonstrates direct memory manipulation, interrupt handling, real-time
keyboard input, and game loop logic.
Key Features:
 Snake movement using arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →)
 Random food generation on the screen
 Score tracking system
 Game over conditions (collision with wall or self)
 Restart or exit option after game over
