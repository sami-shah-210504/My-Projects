# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Development Process

## 1. Define Objectives & Constraints
- **Goal**: e.g., trend following, mean reversion, arbitrage
- **Capital size**
- **Risk tolerance & drawdown limits**
- **Markets/instruments to trade**

## 2. Data Collection
- Choose data source (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Quandl)
- Decide on data type (historical OHLCV, fundamentals, alternative data)
- Clean & preprocess data (remove missing values, adjust for splits/dividends)

## 3. Strategy Idea Generation
- Based on market intuition, academic papers, or patterns
- Examples: Moving Average Crossover, Bollinger Bands, RSI Divergence

## 4. Define Trading Rules
- **Entry criteria** (e.g., SMA50 > SMA200 → Buy)
- **Exit criteria** (e.g., SMA50 < SMA200 → Sell)
- **Position sizing rules** (fixed size, % of capital)
- **Stop-loss / take-profit rules**

## 5. Backtesting
- Apply rules to historical data
- Simulate trades without look-ahead bias
- Measure metrics (return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate)

## 6. Evaluation & Optimization
- Adjust parameters (e.g., SMA lengths)
- Avoid overfitting (use out-of-sample testing & cross-validation)
- Compare with benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500)

## 7. Paper Trading / Forward Testing
- Run strategy live without risking real money
- Check execution timing & slippage impact

## 8. Live Deployment
- Connect to broker API (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca)
- Automate trade execution
- Monitor trades & log performance

## 9. Monitoring & Iteration
- Track performance in real-time
- Update rules if market conditions change
- Keep refining the strategy
